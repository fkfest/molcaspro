Use 
coef=molcaspro('molcas.orbs');
to resort coefficient in the MOLPRO order. The MOLPRO overlap matrix has to be in 'overlap.molpro' file. 

The tolerance in molcaspro.m can be changed according to the accuracy of the overlap matrices. 

Use 
dlmwrite('molpro.orbdump',coef);
to store coefficients for matrop load in MOLPRO. 
One can use splitorb script from https://bitbucket.org/kats/dumpham project to split the orbitals to smaller chunks (otherwise MOLPRO might complain...)
